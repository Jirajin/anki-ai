## Original User Request:
We’re building a responsive, full-stack web application that turns textbook images/PDFs into expertly crafted flashcards using Google Gemini’s multimodal API. The app must feel polished, performant, and intuitive—students upload a page, review extracted lines (or only highlighted text), then instantly get high-quality Q/A cards with built-in memory hooks. The AI should be so expert in creating the flashcard that it can automatically choose what type of flashcards need to be created, tips on how to remember this card, hooks that help remembering etc. Dark themed, minimal aesthetic elegant ui. csv export feature(both single flashcard and all together export).
